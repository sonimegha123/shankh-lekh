# ShankhLekh: Audio Transcriber & Summarizer
ShankhLekh is a powerful offline tool that turns your audio recordings into written text â€” and then summarizes them for quick understanding.

Just upload an audio file (like a recording of a talk), and ShankhLekh will:
- Transcribe the entire audio into clean, readable text.
- Summarize the key points using a local AI model (Mistral via Ollama).
- Let you view and download both the transcript and summary in a clean web interface powered by Streamlit.
